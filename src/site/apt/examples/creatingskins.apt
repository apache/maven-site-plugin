Creating Skins

  If you want to tune the way your site looks, you can use a custom skin to
  provide your own CSS stylesheets. If that is still not enough, you can even tweak
  the output templates that Maven uses to generate the site documentation.

  For an in-depth discussion of site customization, please have a look at
  {{{http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/site-generation.html} Maven: The Complete Reference, Chapter 10. Site Generation}}
  provided by Sonatype.

* About

  A skin contains the following elements:

    * Resources to copy into each project (such as images used by the CSS)

    * A couple of CSS files, containing the visual styling

    * A Velocity template in <<</META-INF/maven/site.vm>>> for an alternate HTML rendering of the site.

    * Since Maven Site Plugin 3.5, an optional {{{/doxia/doxia-sitetools/doxia-skin-model/index.html}skin descriptor}}
    in <<</META-INF/maven/skin.xml>>> containing meta-data about the skin

* Maven Site Skin Archetype

  {{{/archetypes/maven-archetype-site-skin/}<<<maven-archetype-site-skin>>> archetype}} can be used to easily create a complete
  new skin project, including its dedicated <<</META-INF/maven/site.vm>>>.

* Building

  A skin is built like any other JAR - with a <<<packaging>>> of <<<jar>>>.
  No additional plugins are needed.

  Resources should be put in the normal <<<src/main/resources>>> directory.

  Once the JAR is built and deployed, it can be used by projects.

* Constructing the CSS

~~ @todo More information is needed here on constructing the CSS

  If you are interested in constructing your own CSS, it is recommended that
  you copy the file
  {{{https://github.com/apache/maven-default-skin/tree/master/src/main/resources/css/maven-theme.css}<<<maven-theme.css>>>}}
  from Maven Default Skin and modify it to suit your needs.

* Customizing the HTML Output with a Velocity Template

  The format of the Velocity template is currently out of scope for this
  document.

  For more information about how to write Velocity templates see the
  {{{https://velocity.apache.org/engine/2.3/user-guide.html}Velocity User Guide}}
  and
  {{{https://velocity.apache.org/engine/2.3/vtl-reference.html}Velocity Template Language Reference Guide}}.

  Notice that Velocity 2.3 is used since Maven Site Plugin 4.0.0-M2, but version 1.7 was used previously.
