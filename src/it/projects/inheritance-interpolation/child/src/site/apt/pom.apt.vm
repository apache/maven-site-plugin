POM Inheritance and Interpolation

  Since maven-site-plugin uses parent projects values, we need to be sure they have been
  properly interpolated, which is not necessary to general Maven use: outside the reactor, Maven core
  may not do the interpolation job but stop at inheritance step (yet to be proven, but there is
  code in Doxia Sitetools that does workaround against such things, without IT to prove when it
  is/was useful).

  Then maven-site-plugin does project interpolation itself in Doxia Sitetools,
  where usually it relies on core work already done.

* Usual Field Inheritance and Interpolation

  Usual fields (not urls) are inherited "as-is" from parent POM to child, then interpolated at the end.

  This test shows the value of a property that has been defined in parent pom with a value containing
  <<<$\{project.artifactId}>>> expression: here are values at runtime when iterating from project
  to parent:

#set( $p = $project )
*-------*------*-------*
|| level || artifactId || <<<prop>>> property value ||
*-------+------+--------+
#foreach( $i in [1..4] )
#if( $p )|    $i| <<<$p.artifactId>>> | <<<$p.properties.getProperty("prop")>>>
*-------+------+--------+
#set( $p = $p.parent )#end
#end


* Url Field Inheritance and Interpolation

  Url fields (<<<project.url>>>, <<<project.scm.connection>>>, <<<project.scm.developerConnection>>>,
  <<<project.scm.url>>> and <<<project.distributionManagement.site.url>>>)
  are inherited with the addition of artifactId, then interpolated at the end: see
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-model-builder/} reference documentation}}.

  Same test with <<<project.url>>>: top parent defines url with a property that is
  not defined, then property is defined in some childs:

#set( $p = $project )
*-------*------*-------*
|| level || artifactId || <<<project.url>>> value ||
*-------+------+--------+
#foreach( $i in [1..4] )
#if( $p )|    $i| <<<$p.artifactId>>> | <<<$p.url>>>
*-------+------+--------+
#set( $p = $p.parent )#end
#end

* Property from Settings

  Expected values from settings profile to override default values from repo-parent

#set( $p = $project )
*-------*------*-------*
|| level || artifactId || <<<project.distributionManagement.site.url>>> value ||
*-------+------+--------+
#foreach( $i in [1..4] )
#if( $p )|    $i| <<<$p.artifactId>>> | <<<$p.distributionManagement.site.url>>>
*-------+------+--------+
#set( $p = $p.parent )#end
#end
