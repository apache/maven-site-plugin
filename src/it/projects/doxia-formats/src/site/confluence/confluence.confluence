h4. Confluence Markup

Ideally, the markup should be _readable_ and even *clearly understandable* when you are
editing it. Inserting formatting should require few keystrokes, and little thought.

After all, we want people to be concentrating on the words, not on where the angle-brackets
should go.

* Kinds of Markup
** Text Effects
** Headings
** Text Breaks
** Links
** Other
